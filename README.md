## Overview

This project leverages SQL to analyze Netflix's movies and TV shows dataset, delivering insights to inform content strategy. By addressing 20 business questions, I demonstrate advanced SQL skills through complex aggregations, string parsing, and temporal analysis. The analysis uncovers trends in content distribution, audience preferences, and regional patterns, showcasing my ability to extract actionable insights from raw data. Results for each query are included to highlight the dataset's key findings.

**Dataset Source**: [Kaggle Netflix Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows)

**Objectives**:
- Analyze Movies vs. TV Shows distribution.
- Identify patterns in ratings, genres, and regional content.
- Explore content addition trends and thematic elements.
- Showcase SQL proficiency with optimized, scalable queries.

## Dataset Schema

The dataset is structured as follows:

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS netflix;
CREATE TABLE netflix (
    show_id VARCHAR(10),
    type VARCHAR(10),
    title VARCHAR(250),
    director VARCHAR(550),
    casts VARCHAR(1050),
    country VARCHAR(550),
    date_added VARCHAR(55),
    release_year INT,
    rating VARCHAR(15),
    duration VARCHAR(15),
    listed_in VARCHAR(250),
    description VARCHAR(550)
);
```

**Data Considerations**:
- Handled `NULL` values in `director`, `casts`, and `country` using `COALESCE` or filtering.
- Parsed comma-separated fields (`country`, `casts`, `listed_in`) with `UNNEST` and `STRING_TO_ARRAY`.
- Standardized `date_added` using `TO_DATE` for temporal analysis.

## Business Problems, Solutions, and Results

### 20. Monthly Content Addition Patterns
**Purpose**: Identify seasonal trends in content releases.

```sql
SELECT 
    TO_CHAR(TO_DATE(date_added, 'Month DD, YYYY'), 'Month') AS month_added,
    COUNT(*) AS content_count
FROM netflix
WHERE date_added IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY EXTRACT(MONTH FROM TO_DATE(date_added, 'Month DD, YYYY'));
```

**Value**: Informs optimal release schedules.

**Results**:
| month_added | content_count |
|-------------|---------------|
| January     | 738           |
| February    | 563           |
| March       | 742           |
| April       | 764           |
| May         | 632           |
| June        | 728           |
| July        | 827           |
| August      | 755           |
| September   | 770           |
| October     | 760           |
| November    | 705           |
| December    | 813           |

**Insight**: July and December see high content additions, likely tied to summer and holiday seasons.

## Visualization Plan

To enhance insights, I propose visualizations using Python (Matplotlib/Seaborn) or Tableau:
- **Pie Chart**: Movies vs. TV Shows (Query 1).
- **Bar Chart**: Top 5 countries by content count (Query 4).
- **Line Chart**: Content additions by year (Query 17).
- **Heatmap**: Rating-genre combinations (Query 19).
- **Bar Chart**: Monthly content additions (Query 20).

**Sample Python Code** (for Query 1):
```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

data = pd.read_sql("SELECT type, COUNT(*) AS content_count FROM netflix GROUP BY type;", conn)
plt.pie(data['content_count'], labels=data['type'], autopct='%1.1f%%', colors=['#1f77b4', '#ff7f0e'])
plt.title('Movies vs. TV Shows on Netflix')
plt.show()
```

**Value**: Visualizations make insights accessible to stakeholders, enhancing decision-making.

## Findings

- **Content Distribution**: Movies (69.62%) dominate over TV Shows (30.38%), but long-running series (e.g., 23 shows with >5 seasons) drive engagement.
- **Audience Preferences**: TV-MA is the top rating, with Dramas and Comedies leading genres, reflecting diverse viewer interests.
- **Regional Trends**: The U.S. (3689 titles) and India (1046 titles) are key producers, with Indian movies averaging longer durations (125.16 minutes).
- **Thematic Insights**: 15.65% of Movies and 13.96% of TV Shows include 'kill' or 'violence,' indicating demand for action-oriented content.
- **Temporal Patterns**: Content additions peaked in 2019 (2016 titles) and 2020 (1876 titles), with July and December as high-release months.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates advanced SQL skills through 20 queries that uncover actionable insights from Netflix's dataset. The analysis reveals content distribution, audience preferences, regional trends, and temporal patterns, providing a foundation for strategic content decisions. By delivering precise results and proposing visualizations, the project showcases the ability to transform complex data into business value, making it a strong portfolio piece for data analytics roles.
